# Welcome to OpenEO FastApi

The openeo-fastapi is a package intended to assist developers to quickly get their OpenEO Api implementation
up and running without the need to start from scratch. The package defines a framework for developing
your OpenEO Api application, allowing you to use your own processing implementations, apply your own extensions
to the database schema, and finally increase the offering of the baseline api with any additional endpoints you
would like to add.
