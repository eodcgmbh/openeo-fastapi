Provided along with the two 250 m MODIS bands is one additional layer, the Surface Reflectance QC 250 m band. For each pixel, a value is selected from all the acquisitions within the 8-day composite period. The criteria for the pixel choice include cloud and solar zenith. When several acquisitions meet the criteria the pixel with the minimum channel 3 (blue) value is used. Validation at stage 3 has been achieved for all MODIS Surface Reflectance products.",
